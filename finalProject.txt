In the oil and gas industry electronic well logs (i.e. resistivity, gamma-ray, nuetron porosity, bulk density, compressional sonic, etc) are the backbone of subsurface characterization and exploration. However often times we have acess to three or less of these logs in a single wellbore, but not sonic data (compressional sonic) which can provide useful geomechanical information which can inform petrophysical models or be used to train seismic data. Recently, log providers/service companies have been using machine learning techniques which take three or more curves to predict the missing curves in any well-bore. I have already assessed some of the accuracy of these products using withheld/blind data to check the accuracy of the prediction provided. By the end of the class (EO June) my objective is create a supervised ML model that will predict a compressional sonic curve given a GR, ResD, and RhoB curve which has an accuracy and bias which performs close to or better than the products which are being sold to our company presently. I have subsurface log data on >2400 wells, sonic compresional curves of > ~200 wells, which would have a sample every half foot for several thousands feet per wellbore. I have access and permission to use this private data set owned by my employer Encana. However I will have to hide well names, locations, and potentially curve mnemonics so that the data set will not be useful if stolen.
